# aca-checkers

This is a simple teaching project used for the web development class at [Alliance Christian Academy in Lynchburg](https://www.homeschool-life.com/2542/), VA.  

We've been building the project in class and recording our progress each week.  You can watch the video to learn how to build this project on my [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G967YFzV5FQ&list=PLsOFSAIcEBFZGrce84V6HJts5_wpOyG7P).

If you would like to see this project in action, you can also [Play Checkers](https://sharptopco.github.io/aca-checkers/board.html) using this game board.
